A guard was about to signal his train to start when he saw an attractive girl standing on the platform by an open door, talking to another pretty girl inside the carriage. 

一位车上的列车员刚发出信号让火车启动，这时他看见一位很漂亮的姑娘站在站台上一节打开的车厢门旁边，跟车厢里另一位漂亮姑娘在说话。 

"Come on, miss!" he shouted. "Shut the door, please!" 

“快点，小姐!”他喊道：“请把门关上。” 

"Oh, I just want to kiss my sister goodbye," she called back. 

“噢，我还没有和妹妹吻别呢。”她回答道。 

"You just shut that door, please," called the guard, "and I'll see to the rest." 

“请把门关上好了，”列车员说：“其余的事由我负责。”
